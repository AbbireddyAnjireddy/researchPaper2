It is one of the most popular sports in the world, particularly in countries of the Commonwealth.\\n\\n- The game is played on a pitch with a rectangular field. The objective is to score runs by hitting a ball bowled at the batsman's wicket with a bat, and to prevent the opposing team from scoring runs.\\n\\n- There are multiple formats of cricket, the most common being Test cricket, One Day International (ODI), and Twenty20 (T20). Test cricket is the oldest and most prestigious form, played over 5 days. ODIs and T20s are shorter formats played in a single day.\\n\\n- The sport originated in England in the 16th century and is the country's national summer sport. Cricket is played professionally in many countries, with the top teams including England, Australia, India, Pakistan, South Africa, and New Zealand.\\n\\n- Some of the most famous cricket tournaments are the Cricket World Cup, the Ashes between England and Australia, and the Indian Premier League (IPL) Twenty20 tournament.\\n\\n- Key skills in cricket include batting, bowling, fielding, and wicket-keeping. Popular shots include the cover drive, the pull shot, and the sweep shot.\\n\\n- Cricket has a rich history and culture, with the game being deeply intertwined with the identity and traditions of many cricket-playing nations.\", type='text')]\n"]}],"source":["# 6.
