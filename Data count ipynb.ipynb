Acting on a tip-off as they attempted to board the Air Craft,my officials carried out a thorough search on the air craft and discovered that the 6 trunk boxes contained foreign currencies amounting to US$197,570,000.00(One Hundred and  Ninety-Seven Million Five Hundred Seventy Thousand United States Dollars).\\n\\nI declared only (5) five boxes to the government and withheld one (1) in my custody containing the sum of (US$30,000,000.00) Thirty Million United States Dollars Only, which has been disguised to prevent their being discovered during transportation process.Due to several media reports on the late head of state about all the money him and his co-government officials stole from our government treasury amounting\\nto US$55 Billion Dollars (ref:ngrguardiannews.com) of July 2nd 1999. Even the London times of July 1998 reported that General Abacha has over US$3.Billion dollars in one account overseas. We decided to conceal this one (1)box till the situation is calm and quite on the issue. The box was thus deposited with a security company here in Nigeria and tagged as \\\"Precious Stones and Jewellry\\\" in other that its\\ncontent will not be discovered. Now that all is calm, we (myself and two of my colleagues in the operations team) are now ready to move this box out of the country through a diplomatic arrangement which is the safest means. \\n\\nHowever as government officials the Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us by law to operate any foreign account or own foreign investment and the amount of money that can be found in our account\\ncannot be more than our salary on the average, thus our handicapp and our need for your assistance to help collect and keep safely in your account this money.\\n\\nTherefore we want you to assist us in moving this money out of Nigeria. We shall definitely compensate you handsomely for the assistance. We can do this by instructing the Security Company here in Nigeria to\\nmove the consignment to their affiliate branch office outside Nigeria through diplomatic means and the consignment will be termed as Precious Stones and Jewelleries\\\" which you bought during your visit to Nigeria and is being transfered to your country from here for safe keeping. Then we can arrange to meet at the destination country to take the delivery of the consignment. You will thereafter open an account there and lodge the Money there and gradually instruct remittance to your Country. \\n\\nThis business is 100% risk free for you so please treat this matter with utmost confidentiality .If you indicate your interest to assist us please just e-mail me for more Explanation on how we plan to execute the transaction.\\n\\nExpecting your response urgently.\\n\\nBest regards,\\n\\nMr. Ben Suleman\\n\\n\",\n          \"Dear sir, \\n \\nIt is with a heart full of hope that I write to seek your help in respect of the context below. I am Mrs. Maryam Abacha the former first lady of the former Military Head of State of Nigeria General Sani Abacha whose sudden death occurred on 8th of June 1998 as a result of cardiac arrest (heart attack) while on the seat of power. \\nI have no doubt about your capability and good-will to assist me in receiving into your custody (for safety) the sum of US$25 Million willed and deposited in my favour by my late husband in a security and deposit company. Though my contact to you for this assistance is not anchored on any personal ecommendation, I pray your understanding, good will and sincere assistance to respond to this message with honest intensions and concern. \\nThis money is currently deposited here with a security company as miscellaneous awaiting collection and according to the agreement entered into at the time of deposit between my late husband and the Security Company at the time of deposit; the collection centre is in Ghana. As it is legally required, the administration of my late husband's properties is under the authority of the family's lawyer Tony Musa. \\n \\nMy Dear JK, since the demise of my husband, the present regime has been probing my late husband's wealth and properties, the London Newsweek of 13th march 2000 referred. The investigating team led by Enrico Monfrini, the lawyer acting on behalf of the Nigerian government has so far submitted their report and presently, some liquid cash and assets, movable and immovable, have been frozen and seized both locally here and internationally and my last hope is rested on the immediate security of this fund in your custody. Also, Johnnie Cochran, the lawyer who defended OJ Simpson, has been brought in by the Abacha entourage to help them retain the disputed funds. Fortunately, our family lawyer had secretly protected the \\\"Personal will\\\" of my husband from the notice of the investigators and have strictly advised that the willed money be urgently moved into an overseas account of Trusted Foreign family friend without delay. For security reasons and f!\\nurther advise,! no relations or fr! \\niends of ours should be used; as this is a measure of security. The government had earlier placed foreign travel embargo on all our family members and seized all known local and International outfits of our business empire. \\nThe situation has been so terrible that we are virtually living on the assistance of well-wishers. In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this \\\"SOS\\\" call to save my children and I from a hopeless future. \\nI hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort, immensely, which will be discussed between you, the Attorney and I. On your immediate response, the Attorney will travel to Ghana where both of you will meet, and thereafter proceed to the deposit company for the claims. \\nThe documentations include, most importantly, Power of Attorney and Certificate of Deposit amongst few others. These documents will be sent to you by Fax, as you would have to present them for proper claims. \\nPlease, be rest assured that this transaction is completely safe and legal but must be kept strictly to yourself even after the funds have been secured into our custody.

No other details\\nwere immediately available.\\nThe man had demanded talks with high government officials, the Interfax and\\nITAR-Tass news agencies said. Ekho Moskvy radio reported that he wanted to\\ntalk with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\\nPolice and security forces rushed to the Security Service building, within\\nblocks of the Kremlin, Red Square and the Bolshoi Ballet, and surrounded the\\nman, who claimed to have one and a half tons of explosives, the news\\nagencies said. Negotiations continued for about one and a half hours outside\\nthe building, ITAR-Tass and Interfax reported, citing witnesses.\\nThe man later drove away from the building, under police escort, and drove\\nto a street near Moscow's Olympic Penta Hotel, where authorities held\\nfurther negotiations with him, the Moscow police press service said. The\\nmove appeared to be an attempt by security services to get him to a more\\nsecure location. \\n\\n------------------------ Yahoo!

I'm told it can also\n","make phone calls. If that's what you want, then buy it. If not, then\n","don't. If you want an iPhone without the phone, buy an iPod Touch, but\n","it doesn't run third-party applications either. (So much for the\n","\"network security\" argument, but never mind that.)\n","\n","Buy it for what it is, or don't buy it at all. Your choices don't get\n","any more granular than that. Apple has been unwaveringly clear that\n","the iPhone is theirs. Not yours, not Ambrosia's, not J. Random\n","Hacker's. You may own the hardware, but you only have a limited\n","license to use the software, and an ongoing contract to use the\n","network. If you don't like those terms, your only recourse is to shop\n","somewhere else to begin with.\n","\n","I have a friend who purchased an iPhone on day 1. She will never hack\n","it to add unauthorized applications or get it to work with another\n","carrier. She uses it every day, raves about it, and says it has\n","changed her life. She doesn't even resent the $200 price drop. Her\n","only regret is that she couldn't buy it sooner.\n","\n","Apple is betting that there are a lot of people like her, and not a\n","lot of people like. well, like me. Or, if you hacked your iPhone, like\n","you either.\n","\n","Once upon a time, I bought an iPod Video 5G. It did what I wanted. It\n","was based on documented video standards, so I could make my own\n","videos. I still use it every day (connected to an iGroove in my home\n","office). But it's been a bit of a hassle to continue using it after\n","leaving the Apple universe and switching to Linux on my primary\n","workstation. Smart people have reverse-engineered the undocumented\n","iPod database and allowed it to work (syncing music with Amarok or\n","videos with gtkPod), but I view these as temporary hacks to get me\n","through this transition period, after upgrading my desktop but before\n","upgrading my music device. (That reverse-engineering is an ongoing\n","effort, by the way. I don't know or care if Apple was intentionally\n","malicious or if it was just collateral damage, the end result is the\n","same: time and effort spent chasing Apple's tail.) When this iPod\n","dies, I won't buy another; I'll buy something that works\n","out-of-the-box with my Linux workstation. Live by the penguin, die by\n","the penguin. Apple doesn't want my business, so why reward them?\n","\n","I don't understand this continuing obsession with buying things that\n","you need to break before they do what you want. It's not just the\n","iPhone; people did the exact same thing with the AppleTV too.\n","Primarily to add support for other video codecs, like DivX and XviD.\n","Why? (No seriously, why? I bought a Philips DVP 5960 for $60. It's a\n","DivX-certified DVD player with a USB port. Out of the box, it'll play\n","a DVD-R full - or a thumb drive full - of AVI files.) I thought the\n","big draw for Apple hardware was that \"It Just Works.\" By breaking it,\n","you must know you're giving up the \"Just Works\" factor, so what's\n","left? Rounded corners?\n","\n","My current theory is that it's some twisted form of wish fulfillment.\n","\"I wish this company understood the value of openness, but they don't,\n","so I'm going to keep buying their closed, crippled shit until they get\n","it.\" Yeah, let me know how that works out for you. And while you were\n","waiting breathlessly for them to \"get it,\" Apple locked out\n","third-party videos. And third-party hardware. And third-party\n","ringtones, applications, and carriers. ProsperityOpenness is just\n","around the corner!\n","\n","John Gruber makes this point, perhaps more constructively:\n","\n","There's only one way to pressure Apple into opening up iPhone\n","development, and it isn't by developing underground iPhone apps. It's\n","by not buying iPhones. Money talks, and right now, there doesn't seem\n","to be a shortage of people willing to give Apple money in exchange for\n","a completely closed iPhone.\n","\n"," \n","\n","' with link or location/anchor > 2079 characters since it exceeds Excel's limit for URLs.\n","  warn(\n","/usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages/xlsxwriter/worksheet.py:1249: UserWarning: Ignoring URL 'http://www.portugalgolf.de/English/Golf_Clubs/Porto_English/porto_english.html seven courses to choose from!

Miscalibration somehow \n","never seems to happen when you use the airport touchscreens, hopping to \n","\"2\" bags when you press \"1\" bag, but according to voting machine vendors \n","it is not uncommon when casting votes. A touch on one part of the \n","machine can register on a different part of the machine due to screen \n","miscalibrations, but this doesn't seem to explain what Welch saw.\n","\n","What Welch witnessed was votes that registered CORRECTLY when he touched \n","the screen, switching later to a different vote choice, when he was \n","almost finished voting the full page.\n","\n","Welch was stunned to see a correctly marked vote take on a life of its \n","own, hopping over to a different spot while he voted on other items. He \n","called an elections worker over to show him the problem. The elections \n","worker helped him re-vote the ballot, and both men watched as the vote \n","registered correctly, but later spontaneously altered to shift to \n","another ballot choice.\n","\n","What is especially interesting about this report is this: The iVotronic \n","voting machines display sets of ballot questions on several different \n","screens, called \"pages.\" If a voting machine alters the vote after a \n","voter has progressed to a later page, the voter /won't witness the \n","movement of the vote from one selection to another./\n","\n","Even if voters take the extra time to page back through every ballot \n","screen in the election, they may not catch the error -- and even if they \n","catch the error, both voters and poll workers may attribute it to voter \n","error. Since the vote may be designed to change AFTER the page is \n","turned, even paging back to \"check\" does not stop the vote from morphing \n","back to an incorrect selection once the voter leaves the page.\n","\n","What Welch saw was not a screen calibration problem because it \n","registered on the screen correctly. It was not \"voter error\" because he \n","literally watched the vote re-write itself to another selection, not \n","once, but twice.\n","\n","The election worker called the Wharton County elections office. Welch \n","was astute enough to see that the suggested solution was not responsive \n","to the real issue:\n","\n","\"You may continue on with this ballot if you like,\" said the elections \n","worker after conferring with Wharton County elections personnel, \"Or I \n","can void this and you can start over.\"\n","\n","This is a machine that had already demonstrated it can't be trusted. \n","This is a machine that would fail the much-touted \"Logic & Accuracy\" \n","testing purported to prove voting machines don't cheat. This is a \n","machine that would not have passed certification tests had it performed \n","this way for the test labs. This is a machine that has no business \n","counting votes at all.\n","\n","And because the iVotronic voting systems are centrally programmed, and \n","the programming defines how the machine counts its votes, this is a \n","machine that has single-handedly cast doubt on every other iVotronic \n","voting machine in Wharton County.\n","\n","Jim Welch spoke with Wharton County Clerk Judy Owens about the matter, \n","and she provided answers that were even more unrelated to the problem:\n","\n","\"You can go back and check your vote before casting it,\" she pointed \n","out, referring to the voter's ability to page back one by one to review \n","each panel. But if the machine can alter a vote -- especially if the \n","timing is such that this happens after you have moved to a new page -- \n","what good will that do?\n","\n","\"We can print each vote out,\" she said, but Welch astutely questioned \n","how and when votes can be printed, They aren't printed at the same time \n","as the voter votes, and the printouts simply re-create what the computer \n","program records, so what good is that?\n","\n","*What can be done about this?*\n","\n","Welch has indicated that he will be willing to file certain public \n","records requests to cast more light on this issue.

We stood beside each other through the darkest days of the Cold War as partners in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. We celebrated with them over the fall of the Soviet Empire and the liberation of Eastern Europe from the yoke of communism. Tragically, a generation from now, we may be bitter adversaries. Europe has increasingly fallen under the spell of a political ideology that Hudson Institute scholar John Fonte has termed \"progressive transnationalism\". The key doctrines of this form of post-communist progressivism contain some fairly pernicious ideas. Among these are the deconstruction of nationalism, the promotion of post-nationalist ideas of citizenship (i.e. a \"global\" citizenry), a redefinition of democracy, and the pooling of national sovereignty into multinational groups such as the United Nations. The European Union, itself a multinational organization built through the pooling of sovereignty by European nations, is post-democratic. While there is a European Parliament, the EU's power resides mainly in the unelected European Commission (EC) and its unelected President, who face few limits to their power. Instead of a limited, consensual form of government, where elected representatives promulgate constitutional laws, the EU has an appointed, oligarchic executive, along with a large attendant bureaucracy, whose orders are not constitutionally limited in any real sense. Moreover, the EU has been unwilling to accept the democratically expressed wishes of the people themselves when those wishes conflict with the results desired by the EU's political elite. Both the EC and the European Court of Justice regularly overturn the national laws of democratically elected EU member governments. This is a step backward in Europe's political development. European criticism of America is on the rise, and the European list of complaints about America is a long and growing one. They dislike the fact that our republican system of government is not based on proportional representation. They hate the fact that our citizens own guns. They despise the fact that we execute murderers. They resent the fact that our economy is so large, and that Americans consume so much. They also resent?and fear - the fact that we have the ability to project American power anywhere in the world. On August 9, 2002, Adrian Hamilton wrote a column in the UK's Independent newspaper, in which he identified the US as a rogue state who should be restrained, perhaps by a European military invasion, followed by a decade or so of occupation. Fortunately, the article is satirical not because it exaggerates the way European progressives view the US, but rather because the impotence of European military power makes the idea of an invasion of the US literally fantastic. At least, for now. Despite the tongue-in-cheek nature of this editorial, however, the fact remains that America is increasingly viewed this way by the European intellectual and political elite. The Europeans actively desire a world where the United Nations keeps in check the activities of sovereign states. Because they have built such a system in Europe, they feel it's valid for the rest of the world. America, however, is the biggest obstacle to such a system. The Europeans cannot understand why America places a higher value on the ethos of national sovereignty and limited, consensual, and constitutional government, than it does on compliance with international \"norms.\" They view all departures from such norms as aberrant. Because the UN member states all have an equal vote in prescribing international norms, they assume that, since the process is ostensibly legitimate, the results must be as well. The trouble with this idea, of course, is that it gives the views of non-democratic, authoritarian states the same weight as those of free, democratic societies. It sanctifies the process, with no regard to the actual results. Thus, they are unable to make any moral distinction between the US refusals to join in a given international effort because we wish to preserve the liberty of our citizens, and similar refusals from Iraq because its dictator wishes to maintain his firm grip on power. Our repeated references to the US Constitution, and our unwillingness to bypass its provisions to comply with international norms, are incomprehensible to them. They assume, therefore, that our refusal is based on arrogance, rather than on a commitment to constitutional rights. None of this bodes well for the future of Euro-American friendship, or cooperation. If the Europeans continue to reject traditional liberalism in favor of the new progressivism, their criticism of the US will rise, while their tolerance of our differences will fall. Obviously, in such a political atmosphere, the opportunities for conflict will inevitably increase. That thought is frightening enough. Even more frightening, however, is the thought that such a conflict might be averted by our own acceptance of the new ideology of transnational progressivism. --  ----------------- R. A.

The \n","technologies they use include Wi-Fi - the emerging standard for high-speed \n","wireless networking also known as 802.11b.

All of those who perished must never be forgotten. The footprints of the fallen Twin Towers and a portion of the 16-acre site must be dedicated to a memorial and civic amenities that recall the sacrifices that were made there and the anguish that those senseless acts of terror created for the victims' families and, indeed, for all of us. But for the good of the city and the region, the 10-million-plus square feet of commercial and retail space that was destroyed with the Twin Towers must be replaced on the site. About 50,000 people worked in the World Trade Center. Those jobs are lost, along with those of another 50,000 people who worked in the vicinity. Together, those jobs in lower Manhattan, for which the Trade Center was the economic stimulus, produced annual gross wages of about $47 billion, or 15% of the annual gross wages earned in the entire state. Some of the firms have relocated elsewhere in the city and region, but many have not. New York City is facing a budget deficit. Without additional jobs, the deficit may become permanent. This is one reason for the importance of rebuilding. If we do not replace the lost space, lower Manhattan never will regain the vibrancy it had as the world's financial center. Love them or hate them, and there were lots of New Yorkers on both sides of the issue, the Towers made a powerful statement to the world that said, \"This is New York, a symbol of our free economy and of our way of life.\" That is why they were destroyed. This is a second reason why the towers must be replaced, and with buildings that make a potent architectural statement. In recent weeks, redevelopment proposals have been circulated from many sources. Most of these focus not on the Trade Center site, however, but on all of lower Manhattan. Further, many believe that the 10 million square feet either could be located elsewhere, scattered in several sites, or simply never rebuilt. These proposals miss the point. What was destroyed, and what must be recovered, was the Trade Center, not all of lower Manhattan. Except over the towers' footprints, where there must be no commercial development, the office and retail space lost has to be rebuilt on or close to where it was. Access to mass transit makes the site ideal for office space of this size. That was a major reason why the Twin Towers were leased to 97% occupancy before 9/11. None of the other sites proposed for office development has remotely equal transportation access. With the reconstruction of the subway and PATH stations, plus an additional $4.5 billion in transit improvements planned, such as the new Fulton Transit Center and the direct \"Train-to-the-Plane\" Long Island Rail Road connection, the site becomes even more the logical locus of office development. And New York will need the space. Before 9/11, the Group of 35, a task force of civic leaders led by Sen. Charles Schumer and former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, concluded that the city would need an additional 60 million square feet of new office space by 2020 to accommodate the anticipated addition of 300,000 new jobs. The loss of the Twin Towers only heightens the need. As for those who say that 10 million square feet of office space downtown cannot be absorbed by the real estate market, I would simply point out that history shows them wrong. New York now has about 400 million square feet of office space. All new construction underway already is substantially leased up. New York had 48 million square feet of vacant office space at the beginning of the recession in 1990. By 1998, this space had been absorbed, at an annual rate of about 6 million square feet. We are seeking to rebuild 10 million square feet on the Trade Center site over a period of about 10 years, with the first buildings not coming on line until 2008 and the project reaching completion in 2012. This is an annual absorption rate of about a million feet, much lower than the 1990s' rate. Those who argue that New York cannot reabsorb office space that it previously had are saying that the city has had its day and is entering an extended period of stagnation and decline. I will not accept this view, nor will most New Yorkers. Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a recent interview with the New York Times that the city \"has to do two things: memorialize, but also build for the future.\" I believe that the Twin Towers site can gracefully accommodate -- and that downtown requires -- office and retail space of architectural significance, a dignified memorial that both witnesses and recalls what happened, and cultural amenities that would benefit workers as well as residents of the area. The challenge to accomplish this is enormous. But our city is up to the task.

The tags have no physical effect, but rather elicit a strong emotional response from the reader. Top of the list is  (War on TerrorT). The tag, when judiciously applied, will immediately provoke violent anger against ragheads, thus: Charity agencies report that Iraqi leader Sadaam Hussein has adopted the African dictatorial habit of eating his political opponents. Of particular interest to British code-monkeys is the new  (I'm hurting too). This is designed for use when reporting on the life of Elizabeth the Queen Mother and other recently dead famous people: She touched our lives in so many ways with her common touch and her instinctive understanding of ordinary people. She will be sadly missed. The instantaneous effect is to reduce the reader to teary-eyed and self-indulgent wallowing in which he or she becomes unaccountably upset about the death of a complete stranger. Political reporting also looks to benefit from the new  tag. Any government ministerial pronouncement is thus rendered immediately transparent: Tony Blair was quick to defend transport secretary Byers, calling him \"the most honest man it has been my privilege to know\". And, in a much-needed boost to satire sites, W3C has formally ratified the controversial . This guarantees any text contained within it complete immunity from prosecution: Naomi Campbell, we can confirm, is a talentless, drug-addicted perjurer who believes that good looks alone can justify her appalling and obnoxious behaviour. The new tags have been warmly received by the programming community. W3C has, however, warned that they are to be used economically. It has further cautioned that they should never be used together, since the effect on the reader could be catastrophic: In response to reports that the Queen Mother had fallen victim to Sadaam Hussein's Axis of EvilT chemical weapons programme, Stephen Byers noted: \"She was everybody's favourite grandmother who touched the lives of billions. The only consolation we can gain from this tragedy is that all of the UK's trains will be running on time by next Monday.

But this time he's\n","several years behind. The idea of using epostage\n","to stop spam has been discussed quite a bit. The\n","problem is how to get over the adoption hump.\n","Until most people are taking one form of epostage,\n","most people don't have enough incentive to download\n","and install something that allows them to pay it.\n","Until most people are set up to pay it, any form of\n","epostage I require closes my mailbox to unknown\n","senders from whom I want to receive mail. And even\n","from known senders. Giving someone my email address\n","doesn't automatically put them in my white list.\n","\n","Hashcash tries to lower the adoption barrier by\n","removing the need to pay money for epostage.\n","Instead, the sender burns processing time on his\n","computer, answering a cryptographically hard\n","challenge. But even this requires set-up. There is\n","inadequate incentive to do so until there is a\n","standard mechanism, but no standard mechanism is\n","born until a significant fraction of the market\n","has taken that first step. It may take government\n","action, to institute an effective epostage\n","standard!\n","\n","I think the better idea is to require that people\n","off your white list \"hand sign\" email to you. A\n","couple of companies are now trying to implement\n","this. An email sender, if not on your white list,\n","must respond to a verification email or go to a\n","website, by a process that is very simply for a\n","human sender, but difficult for a spammer to\n","automate. Where epostage requires a standard\n","mechanism, a variety of mechanisms for \"hand\n","signing\" would frustrate spammers while making it\n","no more difficult for legitimate senders. I'm\n","hoping Eudora and some of the other big mail\n","clients incorporate this kind of feature. The\n","advantage to putting this in the mail client is\n","that the required \"hand sign\" can be personalized:\n","\n","  \"Your attempt to email David Friedman is\n","  blocked until you fill in the blank: The\n","  Incredible ______ Machine.\"\n","\n","It will be a long time before spammers have a\n","process that defeats millions of personal\n","challenges. On the other hand, I have a hack in\n","mind that would work a large percentage of the\n","time. But I'm not telling. If spammers did figure\n","out such hacks, people would then improve their\n","challenges. Yeah, this would lead to another\n","arms race, and spam would leak through to the\n","unwitting. But this arms race is one that helps\n","spammers identify and target the part of the\n","population whose challenges are sub-par, which\n","is their natural prey. People like David aren't\n","in the market for herbal Viagra or back alley\n","debt consolidation.\n","\n","Since David is an anarchist, I'm surprised he\n","didn't point out that spam is the result of\n","government.
